	<h1>Creating your own web page</h1>
	<p>After creating a new HTML file inside of the Web Perspective,
		you can code whatever you may want, and Eclipse has a very cool
		feature that allows you to open up your code inside a Web Browser,
		using Eclipse. You may also see in real time what changing your code
		may do to the web browser.
	<h1>Styling your own web page</h1>
	<p>
		Once you have an HTML file created and you've started a web page that
		has some content on it, you may find it to be very boring and bland.
		You may then want to create a <strong>CSS</strong> file to style your
		page. With the web perspective, you can just create a new file and
		save it under CSS, and start styling away.
	</p>
	<h1>Using XML with Web Perspective</h1>
	<p>Another cool feature of the Web Perspective is that not only can
		you code in HTML and CSS, it also offers an XML workspace as well. If
		you find coding in XML to be easier or to be more efficient, you can
		just as easily select XML instead of selecting HTML.</p>
	<h1>Switching back to the Java Perspective</h1>
	<p>If you have another project to work on, or you simply want to
		create a program using Java, you can very easily switch back to the
		Java Perspective just by clicking the button in the top right "Open
		Perspective", and scroll down until you see "Java", and select that
		option. And there you have it, you're coding back in Java.</p>
