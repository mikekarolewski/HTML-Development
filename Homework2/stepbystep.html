		<strong>Step 1:</strong>
	</h2>
	<p>First, from the "File" menu, select "New", this will display
		many different options. The one you want to select will be "Project".
		This will be shown in the following screenshot.</p>

	</p>
	<h2>
		<strong>Step 2:</strong>
	</h2>
	<p>After selecting "Project", you will be faced with many different
		folders. The one you will be most concerned with is "Web". Click
		"Web", then select "Dynamic Web Project", and finally the "Next>"
		button, which is shown here.</p>

	</p>
	<h2>Step 3:</h2>
	<p>Now that your project is created and should show up in your
		workbench, the next step is to create the HTML file. To do this,
		right click on the project, and select "HTML File", as shown.</p>
	<p>
		<img src="Pictures/screenshot3.png" alt="Screenshot 3" width="60"
			height="66" />
	</p>
	<h2>Step 4:</h2>
	<p>We've already created an HTML file, so why not add some flavor
		to it? With CSS styling of course! CSS is a great way to style your
		web page and you can easily create a CSS type file by right clicking
		the project, hitting "File" and when you save the file, save it under
		the suffix ".css". For example, a CSS type file would look like
		"style.css".</p>

	<p>
		<img src="Pictures/screenshot5.png" alt="Screenshot 5" width="60"
			height="66" />
