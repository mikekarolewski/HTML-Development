	<blockquote>
		Heuristic search is arguably the most successful paradigm in Automated
		Planning, which greatly improves the performance of planning
		strategies. However, adding heuristics usually leads to very
		complicated planning algorithms. In order to study different
		properties (e.g. completeness) of those complicated planning
		algorithms, it is important to use an appropriate formal language and
		framework. In this paper, we argue that Transaction Logic is just such
		a specification language, which lets one formally specify both the
		heuristics, the planning algorithm, and also facilitates the discovery
		of more general and more efficient algorithms. To illustrate, we take
		the well-known regression analysis mechanism and show that Transaction
		Logic lets one specify the concept of regression analysis easily and
		thus express <b><em>RSTRIPS</b></em>, a classical and very complicated
		planning algorithm based on regression analysis. Moreover, we show
		that extensions to that algorithm that allow indirect effects and
		action ramification are obtained almost for free. Finally, a compact
		and clear logical formulation of the algorithm lets us prove the
		completeness of <b><em>RSTRIPS</b></em>-a result that, to the best of
		our knowledge, has not been known before.

	<blockquote>
		State space planning algorithms have been considered as one of the
		main classical planning techniques to solve classical planning
		problems since 1960. In this paper, we show that Transaction Logic is
		an appropriate language and framework to study and compare these
		planning algorithms, which enables one to have more efficient planners
		in logic programming frameworks. Specifically, we take <b><em>STRIPS</em></b>
		planning and forward state space planning algorithms, and show that
		the specification of these algorithms in Transaction Logic lets one
		implement complicated planning algorithms in declarative programming
		languages (e.g. Prolog). We first provide a formal representation of
		these planning algorithms in Transaction Logic, which can be used to
		automatically translate <b><em>STRIPS</em></b> planning problems in
		PDDL to Transaction Logic rules. Then, we use the resulting
		Transaction Logic rules to solve planning problems and compare the
		performance of those algorithms in our simple interpreter implemented
		in XSB Prolog. We use several case studies to show how the linear <b><em>STRIPS</em></b>
		planning algorithm is faster than forward state space search. Our
		experiments highlight the fact that a planner implemented by logic
		programming framework can become faster if an appropriate planning
		algorithm is applied.

	<blockquote>
		Automated planning has been the subject of intensive research and is
		at the core of several areas of AI, including intelligent agents and
		robotics. In this paper, we argue that Transaction Logic is a natural
		specification language for planning algorithms, which enables one to
		see further afield and thus discover better and more general solutions
		than using one-of-a-kind formalisms. Specifically, we take the
		well-known <b><em>STRIPS</em></b> planning strategy and show that
		Transaction Logic lets one specify the <b><em>STRIPS</em></b> planning
		algorithm easily and concisely, and to prove its completeness.
		Moreover, extensions to allow indirect effects and to support action
		ramifications come almost for free. Finally, the compact and clear
		logical formulation of the algorithm made possible by this logic is
		conducive to fruitful experimentation. To illustrate this, we show
		that a rather simple modification of the <b><em>STRIPS</em></b>
		planning strategy is also complete and yields speedups of orders of
		magnitude.

		<em><strong> Roman Bart√°k, Daniel Toropila, <cite>"Solving
					Sequential Planning Problems via Constraint Satisfaction"</cite>,
				Fundamenta Informaticae, vol. 99, no. 2 pp. 125-145, 2010.</em></strong>
	</p>
	<blockquote>Planning problems deal with finding a sequence
		of actions that transfer the initial state of the world into a desired
		state. Frequently such problems are solved by dedicated algorithms but
		there exist planners based on translating the planning problem into a
		different formalism such as constraint satisfaction or Boolean
		satisfiability and using a general solver for this formalism. The
		paper describes how to enhance existing constraintmodels of sequential
		planning problems by using techniques such as symmetry breaking
		(dominance rules), singleton consistency, nogoods, lifting, or
		techniques motivated by the partial-order planning.</blockquote>

	</p>
	<blockquote>A new deductive method for solving robot
		problems is presented in this paper. The descriptions of initial and
		goal situations are given by logical formulas. The primitive actions
		are described by rules, i.e. logical formulas as well. Altogether this
		results in a problem description as in logic programming or in program
		synthesis. A solution is generated by a proof of this description as
		in program synthesis, except that here proofs have to be strictly
		linear. This restriction is the clue to our solution; it can be easily
		added as an option to any theorem prover such as one based on the
		connection method used hereafter. In fact this restriction speeds up
		the proof search considerably. At the same time our approach offers an
		elegant solution of the frame problem.</blockquote>
